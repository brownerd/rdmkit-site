          <h2>Let's set some EFF'n type!</h2>
        </hgroup>
        <p>I promise, this will not be about typographical commandments and shaming. Rather, I'll introduce some tools I made to help us all with the challenge of setting pleasing type online. </p>
        <p>First and foremost, you can do whatever in the hell you want with your type. Web typography best practices don't really exist, and we all know that insane deadlines challenge our best efforts to make everything <em>perfect</em>. All I ask is for a few moments of your time to introduce some tools and practices to empower you be a bad ass at setting type online.</p>
        <hgroup>
          <h2>If you haven't noticed</h2>
          <h3>the typography sucks right now</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
          <button rel="spacing">Click here</button> to add some <em>visual separation</em> between the paragraphs. A simple principle of typography is to increase legibility by separating blocks of text. Believe it or not, there was a time when we didn't do this. Adding spaces to stone, papyrus or simple books meant that stones, scrolls and books had to be BIGGER. This wasn't always feasible for our ancient typographers. Thankfully, the internet provides us with infinite space. Let's take advantage of that.
        </p>
        <hgroup>
          <h2>Things are a tad better</h2>
          <h3>but the headings aren't clear</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p> 
          <button rel="hierarchy">Click here</button> to create <em>visual hierarchy</em> between our headings and paragraph text. At this point in human evolution, bolder or bigger means more important. However, simply making our headings <em>different</em> from our paragraph text further increases legibility by hinting that <em>some</em> text is more <em>important</em> than other text. I also added more spacing to the tops of these headers that the bottom. This helps to show that the heading is separated from the text above and related to the text below. This is fine for now. Let's set some more gaddam type!
        </p>
        <hgroup>
          <h2>Alright, these flippin' measures </h2>
          <h3>are killing me!</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>A "measure" describes the the amount of characters you have in a line of text. Some call it line-length or characters-per-line. Obviously, a long measure is a line that has many characters-per-line. And a short measure has few characters-per-line, thus a short line-length.</p>
        <p>The measures in this page are as long as the page is wide. Back when screen resolutions were 800x600 pixels, it was hard to get super long line measures. Now with high-res screens, line-lengths can get insanely long. Just visit Wikipedia to experience the haven of ridiculously long measures. Here is a screen shot of a line that was 278 characters long! Yikes.</p>
        <figure><img src="/long-measure.24fce8bc.png" alt="Long measures on Wikipedia"></figure>
        <p>So let's introduce the first tool here. I call it CPL. It's for counting characters-per-line. To use, simply click and drag to select this entire line of text. How many characters is it saying the line is? With my browser window fully stretched, I'm getting a read out of 159 characters. While traditional typography from the print world holds a measure of between 45-85 as optimal, the internet has conditioned us to digest stoopid long lines of text. So, instead of telling you what your line-lengths should be, let's just start by being able to count them easily and make informed decisions on what might be best for the current project. </p>
        <hgroup>
          <h2>Cool, we learned how to count characters easily</h2>
          <h3>but these measures are still crazy </h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p data-mzr="35/55/75">I'd say that the biggest issue right now is that the lines are way to long and they are touching each side of the browser window. We need margins. In print we need margins for protecting the text or making notes. However, online, we just need margins for separating site sections and making text look good. We have so much flexable space to use. We need to take advantage of this.</p>
        <p>So how much margin do we need? And what about responsive matters? Let's say that we want a measure of ~35 characters on a mobile screen, ~55 characters on a tablet and ~75 on a desktop. I made another tool called MZR (measure) to visualize this. To make MZR work we need to add a data-attribute that looks like  <code class="language-css">data-mzr="35/55/75"</code>  this to any element in our code.</p>
        <p> 
          <button rel="mzr">Click here</button> to enable MZR so we can visualize multiple measures in one line.
        </p>
        <P>Cool. So now we can use the inspector to figure out how to resize this this column to yield the measures we want. You can use any unit of measurement that you want. I chose to use the <code class="language-css">ch</code>  unit.</P>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <button rel="desktop">Click here</button> to see our measure for <em>desktop</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <button rel="tablet">Click here</button> to see our measure for <em>tablet</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <button rel="mobile">Click here</button> to see our measure for <em>mobile</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here I am setting the width of this column to either 75 characters, 55 characters or 35 characters.</p>
        <hgroup>
          <h2>Sweet, things are looking better</h2>
          <h3>it time to talk about a baseline grid</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>A baseline grid, also known as a vertical grid, is a technique used for normalizing the distrobution of elements on the page. Following a strict baseline grid creates a reliable "vertical rhythm." I'd argue that you don't need to do this, but it can help you to easily figure out how space and size EVERYTHING on your web page. As a result, your content will look and feel frigity fresh. </p>
        <p>I made another tool for setting web type to a baseline grid. I call it VRT, short for vertical rhythm. </p>
        <p> 
          <button rel="vrt">Click here</button> to display the vertical grid.
        </p>
        <p>Press the <code class="language-css">period </code>  key twice</p>

  font-size: 20px;

            <li>Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single-column page set in a serifed typeface in a text size. The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. (p 26)</li>
            <li>Longer measures need more lead than short ones. (p 37)</li>
            <li>Whether oral or visual, longwindedness is very rarely a virtue.</li>
